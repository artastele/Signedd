## [v1.29.2] — P2 Review Permission Fix (Process 4 - Bug Fix)
- **Fixed:** 403 Forbidden error when SPED Teacher accesses "Review P2 Assessments"
- **Issue:** Route `/iep/p2/review` required `iep.sign` permission, but SPED Teacher doesn't have this
- **Root Cause:** Wrong permission on route - SPED Teacher needs to view P2 documents they created
- **Solution:** Changed route permission from `iep.sign` to `iep.view`
- **Impact:**
  - ✅ SPED Teacher can now access P2 review list
  - ✅ Guidance can still access (has `iep.view`)

  - `iep.sign` - Sign/approve P2 documents (Guidance, Principal only)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `routes/web.php` - Changed `/iep/p2/review` permission from `iep.sign` to `iep.view`
  - `routes/web.php` - Changed `/iep/p2/{id}/review` permission from `iep.sign` to `iep.view`

- **Root Cause:** Two `submit()` methods existed:
  1. Line 161: SPED Teacher submit (Process 3 - current implementation)
  2. Line 550: Parent submit (old Process 3 - deprecated)
- **Solution:** Removed duplicate parent submit method (line 545-625)
- **Impact:**

## [v1.12] — Use Existing LRN for Transfer/Returning Students (Process 2 Part 2 - Enhancement)
- **Built:** Smart LRN handling for transfer and returning students
- **Issue:** System always generated new LRN, ignoring existing LRN from enrollment form
- **Impact:** Transfer/returning students lost their original LRN
- **Solution:** Check if LRN exists in enrollment form before generating new one
- **Logic:**
  - **New students (no LRN):** Generate new 12-digit LRN + create account
  - **Transfer students (has LRN, no account):** Use existing LRN + create new account
  - **Returning students (has LRN, account exists):** Use existing LRN + reset password + reactivate account
- **Implementation:**
  - Modified `StudentModel::createStudentRecord()` to check for existing LRN
  - Modified `StudentModel::createLearnerAccount()` to handle existing accounts
  - Updated email templates to differentiate new vs password reset
  - Updated notifications to show appropriate message
  - Added validation: LRN must be exactly 12 digits
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/Models/StudentModel.php` - Enhanced LRN logic, account creation, email/notification methods
- **Workflow:**
  1. Parent submits enrollment with LRN field (optional)
  2. SPED Teacher approves enrollment
  3. SPED Teacher clicks "Create Learner Account"
  4. System checks if LRN exists in enrollment form
  5. **If LRN exists:**
     - Validates format (12 digits)
     - Checks if account exists with that LRN
     - If account exists: Reset password, reactivate, send "Password Reset" email
     - If no account: Create new account with existing LRN, send "Account Created" email
  6. **If NO LRN:**
     - Generate new LRN (YYYYMMDDNNNN format)
     - Create new account
     - Send "Account Created" email
  7. Parent receives appropriate email and notification
- **Tables modified:** None (uses existing fields)
- **Tested:** Ready for user testing
- **Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing
- **Date:** 2026-05-06

## [v1.11] — Learner Dashboard Routing Fix (Process 2 Part 2 - Bug Fix)
- **Fixed:** Learner accounts now route to learner dashboard instead of general dashboard
- **Issue:** After logging in with LRN, learners were redirected to general/user dashboard
- **Root Cause:** DashboardController switch statement missing case for 'learner' role
- **Solution:** Added `case 'learner':` to route learners to `app/Views/dashboard/learner.php`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/Controllers/DashboardController.php` - Added learner case in switch statement
- **Workflow:**
  1. Learner logs in with LRN
  2. AuthController sets `$_SESSION['role'] = 'learner'`
  3. DashboardController checks role
  4. Routes to learner dashboard (not general dashboard)
- **Tables modified:** None
- **Tested:** ✅ Verified working
